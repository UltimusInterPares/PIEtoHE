# Initial Notes



## The Oxford Introduction to Proto-Indo-European and the Proto-Indo-European World

-  Mallory and Adams kindly provided my least favorite table ever
  -  Vowels are implied to be consonants? I know they're not, but the table seems to think so
  -  No mention of syllabic consonants
  -  What the actual *heck* does *r/3* mean???
    -  I wonder if this isn't an encoding error...
    -  Quote, 'The liquids, nasals, and semivowels are listed in both their consonantal and vocalic forms'
        -  It has to be a typo, like the palatal series

|             | Unvoiced | Voiced | Voiced Aspirate |
|-------------|----------|--------|-----------------|
| Labials     | p        | b      | bh              |
| Dentals     | t        | d      | dh              |
| Palatals    | k        | g      | gh              |
| Velars      | k        | g      | gh              |
| Labiovelars | kʷ       | gʷ     | ghʷ             |
| Sibilants   | s        |        |                 |
| Laryngeals  | h₁       | h₂     | h₃ & h₄         |
| Liquids     | r/3      | l/C    |                 |
| Nasals      | m/i      | n/     |                 |
| Semivowels  | i/y      | u/w    |                 |
| Vowels      | e        | o      | a               |
|             | ē        | ō      | ā               |

-  Laryngeal consonants affect the adjacent vowel
  - *\*h₁* has no affect
  - *\*h₂* and *\*h₄* change *\*-e-* to *\*-a-*
    -  Only distinguishable following two conditions:
        -  Word initial
        -  Reflex attested in Anatolian
    -  If they can't be distinguished, they are annotated as *\*hₐ*
  -  *\*h₃* changes *\*-o-* to *\*-e-*
-  If we suspect a laryngeal but can't identify it, it is annotated as *\*hₓ*

-  I'm going to try and edit this table
