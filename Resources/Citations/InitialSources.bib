	abstract = {This paper is concerned with plotting the 13th and 14th century distribution of the retracted sibilants [S Z] in the languages of continental western and central Europe, as well as Finland and parts of Greece. The investigation, based on both dialectological and philological evidence, shows the kind of detailed phonetic knowledge that is sometimes reconstructable when these two types of data are used in conjunction.},
